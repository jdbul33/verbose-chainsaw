\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The city of South Bend, Indiana operates a call center that serves as a primary point of contact for citizens.  The call center handles topics from nearly all of the city's departments.  Open data, maintained by the city, contains several years worth of information.  An analysis of this data was conducted using Python.  The data was 
analyzed for patterns by time of year, department, and topics with varying methods.  The cleaned, manipulated, and explored data was then developed into an 
interactive dashboard using the Bokeh library.  In doing so, an interactive HTML file can be distributed to the city that can then be utilized, modified, and possibly connected 
directly to the data source.

\section{Background}
The city of South Bend, located in northern Indiana, established a citizen-accessible call center in 2013.  %Make sure this is correct
The call center handles calls from citizens regarding almost every aspect of city interaction, including waste pick-up and removal, water billing and disconnections, 
and code enforcement.  By serving as a central hub for communication, the call center is able to consolidate much of the data regarding citizen/consumer issues.  
Much of this data is available on South Bend's open data portal at https://data-southbend.opendata.arcgis.com.
